# PolicyVote: Shifting Elections from Personalities to Policies

*A proposal for electoral reform that addresses the root dysfunction of modern democracy*

---

## The Problem We Don't Talk About

Democratic elections are supposed to translate citizen preferences into policy outcomes. In practice, they often fail at this basic function—not because of voter fraud or procedural failures, but because of something more fundamental: **we vote for people, not policies**.

Consider what happens during an election campaign. Candidates compete for visibility. Debates become exercises in personal attacks and defensive posturing. Media coverage focuses on gaffes, charisma, and horse-race polling. The actual policy content—what a government will *do* once elected—takes a back seat to personality and tribal affiliation.

This isn't a bug in the system. It's a direct consequence of how we've structured electoral choice. When the ballot asks "who do you want to represent you?" rather than "what do you want your government to do?", the entire apparatus of democratic competition orients around the former question.

The results are predictable:

**Wrong incentives for candidates.** Success requires skill at self-promotion, media management, and opponent attacks. People with genuine policy expertise but no appetite for the spotlight stay away. Those who thrive on attention and recognition are selected for.

**Zero-sum dynamics.** For one candidate to gain support, another must lose it. This creates adversarial politics where cooperation becomes strategically irrational, even when parties share policy goals.

**Accountability gaps.** After election, representatives have broad mandates to act "in the public interest" as they interpret it. Citizens voted for a person, not a program—so which program should be implemented? The connection between voter intent and policy outcome is mediated entirely by the representative's judgment and incentives.

**Media distortion.** Political journalism gravitates toward conflict and personality because that's what the electoral structure makes relevant. Policy analysis is less compelling than political drama when the vote is ultimately about choosing a champion.

These aren't failures of individual politicians or voters. They're structural outcomes of person-centered elections.

## A Different Question

What if elections asked a different question?

Instead of "who do you trust to make decisions for you?", the ballot could ask "what decisions do you want made?" Citizens would vote on policy proposals directly. The aggregate result would create binding mandates that elected representatives must implement.

This is the core of **PolicyVote**: an electoral system where votes are cast for policies rather than personalities. Parties would still exist—they would develop and propose policy programs. But electoral competition would center on those programs, not on the candidates presenting them.

The mechanics shift accordingly:

- **Campaigns become substantive.** When voters choose policies, candidates must explain and defend policies. Personal attacks become less effective because they don't address what's actually on the ballot.

- **Cross-party agreement becomes visible.** If multiple parties include the same policy in their programs, that policy accumulates support from voters across traditional boundaries. Consensus positions gain strength rather than being obscured by partisan framing.

- **Mandates are specific.** "65% of voters supported universal basic income" is a clearer mandate than "Party X won with 35% of the vote." Representatives know exactly what they've been elected to implement.

- **Accountability is traceable.** Did the policy get implemented? Public dashboards can track legislative outcomes against the mandate. Deviation requires justification.

## How It Would Work

PolicyVote separates the democratic process into distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Deliberation

Before voting, policy proposals must be developed, refined, and debated. This phase uses tools designed for productive deliberation rather than divisive argument—platforms like [Pol.is](https://pol.is), which Taiwan's [vTaiwan](https://info.vtaiwan.tw/) initiative has used successfully to find consensus on contentious issues.

Key design principles from vTaiwan's experience:
- Removing reply features reduces trolling and flame wars
- Visualizing opinion clusters helps participants see where consensus is possible
- Focus shifts from "winning arguments" to "attracting broad agreement"

Parties, citizens, and experts can participate in developing proposals. The goal is to produce concrete, actionable policy options—not vague aspirations like "improve healthcare" but specific measures like "establish universal basic income at €800/month."

### Phase 2: Voting

Citizens vote on the refined proposals. The ballot lists specific policies; voters indicate support or opposition to each. For those who prefer not to engage with every item, "bundle" options allow adopting a party's full program or positions in specific policy areas, with the ability to override individual items.

Voting can be:
- **Single election day** (familiar format, Phase 1 implementation)
- **Continuous** (voters can update positions between elections as they learn more—Phase 2 implementation)

### Phase 3: Implementation

Elected representatives are constitutionally bound to implement the policy mandates. Parliament's role shifts from decision-making to implementation—working out details, resolving conflicts between popular but incompatible policies, and handling unforeseen situations within the mandate's boundaries.

A transparency dashboard tracks:
- Each policy mandate and its support level
- How parliament has voted on related legislation
- Where implementation deviates from mandate and why

## A Concrete Example: Universal Basic Income in Finland

Universal Basic Income (perustulo) illustrates the structural problems of person-centered elections and how PolicyVote might address them.

### The Current Situation

At least two Finnish parties—Vihreät (Green League) and Vasemmistoliitto (Left Alliance)—include basic income in their election programs. Polls suggest substantial public interest, and Finland conducted a government-sponsored basic income experiment in 2017-2018.

Yet UBI remains perpetually "on the agenda" without democratic resolution. Why?

**Cross-party support is invisible.** Even if 55% of Finnish citizens support UBI, this doesn't create a mandate if those citizens are distributed across multiple parties. Each voter must choose a full party package; their specific UBI preference has no direct expression.

**Coalition dynamics determine outcomes.** Whether UBI advances depends on which parties form a government and what they trade away in negotiations—not on aggregate citizen preference.

**The mandate is unclear.** If parties supporting UBI get 40% of votes collectively, what mandate exists? Post-election, UBI competes with every other party priority.

### Under PolicyVote: A Simulation

We simulated how the same policy environment would function under PolicyVote. ([Full simulation details available here.](../Research/Case%20Study%20-%20UBI%20in%20Finland.md))

**Deliberation phase** revealed that the population isn't neatly divided into "pro-UBI" and "anti-UBI" camps. A substantial middle exists—people open to various reform models. Consensus emerged on problems (bureaucracy, poverty traps) even where solutions differed.

**Voting phase** produced specific results:

| Proposal | Net Support |
|----------|-------------|
| Conditional Basic Income (€600/month with activity requirements) | +21% |
| UBI Pilot (€800/month unconditional, 50,000 citizens) | +9% |
| Status quo with improvements | -11% |
| No expansion of social security | -38% |

**Key finding**: 31% of simulated voters supported *both* the conditional model and the UBI pilot—they want reform but are flexible on the form. Under the current system, this substantial middle is invisible, split across party votes. Under PolicyVote, it becomes a clear mandate for some form of basic income reform.

**The mandate** is specific: implement conditional basic income, with openness to piloting unconditional models. Parliament knows exactly what citizens voted for. A transparency dashboard tracks implementation. Accountability is concrete.

### What Changes

| Aspect | Current System | PolicyVote |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Mandate | "Party X got 10%" | "52% support conditional BI" |
| Cross-party support | Hidden in party bundles | Visible and actionable |
| Coalition leverage | UBI tradeable for other priorities | Mandate exists regardless of coalition |
| Accountability | "Party broke promises" | Dashboard tracks specific implementation |

The simulation is illustrative, not predictive. Real dynamics would differ. But it demonstrates how structural change affects which questions get asked and which answers become possible.

## What This Doesn't Solve

PolicyVote addresses the structural incentives that make elections personality-focused. It doesn't solve:

**Voter information.** Citizens must still understand policy implications. The deliberation phase helps, but doesn't guarantee informed voting.

**Complexity and expertise.** Some policy details require technical knowledge most voters lack. PolicyVote channels expertise through the deliberation phase and representative implementation, but the tension remains.

**Manipulation.** Policy framing, misleading claims, and well-funded campaigns could still distort outcomes. The structure reduces some manipulation vectors (personal attacks become less relevant) while potentially opening others (policy-focused disinformation).

**Rapid response.** Binding mandates may constrain response to emergencies or unforeseen situations. The system needs mechanisms for genuine emergencies while preventing "emergency" framing from gutting the mandate structure.

**Participation inequality.** Those with more time, education, and resources may participate more in deliberation and voting. This exists in current systems too, but different structures may have different participation patterns.

These are real challenges. They're also present in current electoral systems. The question is whether PolicyVote's tradeoffs are preferable—not whether it's perfect.

## Why This Matters Now

Several converging factors make this worth serious consideration:

**Digital infrastructure exists.** The technical barriers to policy-level voting and mandate tracking have largely fallen. Estonia's digital governance, Taiwan's civic tech, and Switzerland's direct democracy all provide relevant precedents.

**Trust in representative democracy is declining.** Across democracies, citizens report feeling that elections don't translate into policy outcomes they want. This may be because elections aren't actually asking about policy outcomes.

**Political polarization follows predictable lines.** When competition is person-centered, tribal dynamics dominate. Policy-centered competition could reveal that apparent polarization obscures substantial agreement on specific issues.

**Existing tools demonstrate feasibility.** Vaalikone (candidate matching tools) already capture policy positions before elections. vTaiwan demonstrates scalable deliberation. Swiss referendums show direct policy voting works. The pieces exist; they need integration.

## Next Steps

This is a proposal, not a finished system. Key open questions include:

1. **Interface design.** How exactly should proposals move from deliberation to ballot? What thresholds or processes prevent ballot overload while maintaining accessibility?

2. **Conflict resolution.** How should parliament handle mandates that conflict with each other or with existing law?

3. **Pilot scope.** Municipal-level testing could validate (or invalidate) key assumptions before national implementation.

4. **Constitutional integration.** How would mandate obligations interact with existing constitutional frameworks?

5. **Political path.** Who would support this reform? How does it get from proposal to implementation?

I'm developing this concept openly and welcome feedback. The [full documentation](https://github.com/user/repo), including detailed mechanism design, research on related systems, and comparative analysis, is available for review and contribution.

The goal is not to prescribe a specific implementation, but to explore whether reframing the fundamental question of elections—from "who" to "what"—could address dysfunctions that incremental reforms cannot reach.
