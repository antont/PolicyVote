# Thought Experiment: Universal Basic Income in Finnish Elections

*Exploring how PolicyVote might handle a cross-party policy proposal*

---

## Background

Universal Basic Income (perustulo) has been part of Finnish political discourse for decades. Finland conducted a government-sponsored basic income experiment in 2017-2018, providing €560/month to 2,000 unemployed citizens. The experiment generated data and international attention, though findings were mixed and subject to ongoing debate.

As of 2024-2025, several Finnish parties include some form of basic income in their election programs:

**Clear support:**
- **Vihreät (Green League)**: Long-standing support for basic income as part of social security reform
- **Vasemmistoliitto (Left Alliance)**: Advocates for basic income as path to more equitable society
- **Liberaalit (Liberal Party)**: Supports UBI; no parliamentary seats but votes count in elections

**Mixed or partial support:**
- **SDP**: Has expressed openness to basic income models in some forms
- **Keskusta (Centre Party)**: Initiated the 2017-2018 experiment; position varies
- **Kokoomus (National Coalition)**: Some internal support exists; party officially prefers targeted benefits

**Generally opposed:**
- **Perussuomalaiset (Finns Party)**: Opposed to expanding social security in this direction

## The Current System: How UBI Fares in Person-Centered Elections

### What Happens Now

In Finland's current electoral system (proportional representation with party lists and preferential voting), UBI faces structural challenges:

**1. Issue gets bundled with party identity**
- A voter who supports UBI but disagrees with Vihreät on other issues (e.g., nuclear energy, immigration) faces a dilemma
- They can vote for the party with their preferred UBI position but accept a package of other positions
- Or vote for another party and hope UBI somehow advances anyway

**2. Cross-party support is invisible**
- Even if 55% of Finnish citizens support UBI, this doesn't translate into a mandate if those citizens are distributed across multiple parties
- Each party's internal deliberations determine whether UBI advances, not aggregate citizen preference

**3. Campaign dynamics obscure policy**
- Election debates focus on party leader performance, coalition possibilities, and scandals
- UBI becomes one of many issues, rarely receiving focused deliberation
- Media covers "will Party X join coalition with Party Y?" not "how much support does UBI actually have?"

**4. Post-election mandate is unclear**
- If Vihreät gets 10% of vote and Vasemmistoliitto gets 8%, what mandate exists for UBI?
- Coalition negotiations may trade away UBI for other priorities
- Citizens who voted partly for UBI have no direct way to enforce that preference

### Result

Despite substantial public interest and real-world experimentation, UBI remains perpetually "on the agenda" without clear democratic resolution. The issue is hostage to coalition dynamics, party priorities, and the personal preferences of whoever ends up in government.

## PolicyVote Thought Experiment: The Same Election, Different Structure

> **Note**: The following is a thought experiment with illustrative numbers, not a prediction. The specific percentages are plausible but invented to demonstrate how the structure would work. The value is in understanding the *type* of outcomes that become possible, not the exact figures.

### Phase 1: Deliberation

**Setup**: Six months before the election, a deliberation platform (Pol.is-style) opens for social security reform proposals.

**Participants**:
- Political parties submit their proposals
- Citizens can propose alternatives
- Experts provide technical analysis
- ~15,000 citizens participate over three months

**What emerges**:

Initial positions cluster into groups:
- **Pro-UBI** (~40%): Supports unconditional basic income
- **Conditional basic income** (~25%): Supports income floor with some conditions
- **Targeted benefits** (~20%): Prefers current system with improvements
- **Opposed** (~15%): Against expanding social security spending

**The Pol.is dynamic**: As participants draft statements to attract cross-group support, consensus positions emerge:

| Statement | Pro-UBI | Conditional | Targeted | Opposed |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------|---------|
| "Social security system needs simplification" | 92% | 88% | 71% | 54% |
| "Current bureaucracy creates poverty traps" | 89% | 85% | 62% | 41% |
| "Any reform should be piloted before full implementation" | 78% | 91% | 85% | 79% |
| "Basic income should replace, not add to, existing benefits" | 72% | 68% | 45% | 61% |

**Outcome**: The deliberation reveals that:
1. Broad agreement exists on *problems* (bureaucracy, poverty traps, complexity)
2. Disagreement centers on *solutions* (unconditional vs conditional vs targeted)
3. Strong consensus exists on *process* (pilot first, evaluate, then decide)

### Phase 2: Proposal Formulation

Based on deliberation, the following proposals qualify for the ballot:

**Proposal A: Universal Basic Income Pilot**
> Implement a three-year universal basic income pilot covering 50,000 randomly selected citizens, providing €800/month unconditionally. Comprehensive evaluation to inform subsequent national decision.
>
> *Supported by: Vihreät, Vasemmistoliitto*
> *Origin: Deliberation consensus on piloting + UBI advocacy*

**Proposal B: Conditional Basic Income**
> Introduce income floor of €600/month for all adults who meet activity requirements (job-seeking, caregiving, studying, volunteering). Consolidates multiple existing benefits.
>
> *Supported by: SDP, Keskusta*
> *Origin: Deliberation alternative from conditional income cluster*

**Proposal C: Status Quo with Improvements**
> Maintain current targeted benefit system. Increase housing allowance by 15%, simplify application processes, reduce bureaucratic delays.
>
> *Supported by: Kokoomus*
> *Origin: Targeted benefits cluster*

**Proposal D: No Expansion**
> No new social security programs. Focus resources on employment and economic growth.
>
> *Supported by: Perussuomalaiset*
> *Origin: Opposed cluster*

### Phase 3: Voting

Citizens vote on each proposal (support/oppose/abstain). They can also adopt party bundles for convenience.

**Simulated Results**:

| Proposal | Support | Oppose | Abstain | Net Support |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| A: UBI Pilot | 47% | 38% | 15% | +9% |
| B: Conditional | 52% | 31% | 17% | +21% |
| C: Status Quo+ | 34% | 45% | 21% | -11% |
| D: No Expansion | 23% | 61% | 16% | -38% |

**Cross-tabulation reveals** (illustrative):
- ~30% support BOTH Proposal A and B (open to either approach)
- ~15% support A but oppose B (want unconditional only)
- ~20% support B but oppose A (want conditions)
- ~25% oppose both A and B
- ~10% abstain or support only C/D

**Key insight**: The population isn't neatly divided into "pro-UBI" and "anti-UBI." A substantial middle exists that supports *some* form of basic income reform, with varying preferences on the specific model. This middle is invisible in the current system.

### Phase 4: Mandate Creation

The voting creates a clear mandate:

**Strong mandate**:
- Reform social security (Proposals A+B collectively supported by majority)
- Reject pure status quo (C net negative)
- Reject no-expansion (D strongly rejected)

**Specific mandate**:
- Conditional Basic Income (Proposal B) has highest net support (+21%)
- UBI Pilot (Proposal A) has positive but lower support (+9%)

**Parliament's task**: Implement Proposal B (conditional basic income) as primary mandate. Proposal A's support indicates citizen openness to unconditional models—parliament may incorporate pilot elements or sunset clause for evaluation.

### Phase 5: Implementation and Tracking

**Transparency Dashboard shows**:

```
MANDATE: Conditional Basic Income (Proposal B)
Support level: 52% (+21% net)
Status: Implementation in progress

Legislative actions:
- [✓] Framework bill introduced (March)
- [✓] Committee review completed (May)
- [~] Floor vote scheduled (September)
- [ ] Implementation regulations
- [ ] Benefit consolidation

Related mandates:
- UBI Pilot (47% support): Elements incorporated via evaluation clause
- System simplification (92% deliberation consensus): Addressed in framework

MP Compliance:
- 156/200 MPs voting in alignment with mandate
- 28 voting against (17 Kokoomus, 8 PS, 3 other)
- 16 absent
```

## What's Different: Comparison

| Aspect | Current System | PolicyVote |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Mandate clarity** | "Vihreät got 10%" - unclear UBI mandate | "52% support conditional BI" - specific mandate |
| **Cross-party visibility** | Hidden in party bundles | 31% support both A and B across parties |
| **Campaign focus** | Party leaders, coalition math | Specific proposals and their merits |
| **Accountability** | "Party broke promises" (vague) | Dashboard tracks implementation of specific mandate |
| **Coalition leverage** | UBI tradeable for other priorities | Mandate exists regardless of coalition composition |
| **Middle ground** | Invisible (forced into party camps) | Revealed (large group open to either reform) |

## Lessons from This Thought Experiment

### 1. Cross-party consensus becomes actionable

In this scenario, roughly a third of voters supported both the UBI pilot AND the conditional model. Under the current system, these voters are split between parties and their shared preference for "some form of basic income reform" has no political expression. Under PolicyVote, this preference becomes a strong mandate for reform.

### 2. Deliberation changes the question

The initial framing ("UBI yes or no?") transformed through deliberation into richer options. The consensus on piloting emerged organically. This mirrors vTaiwan's experience where deliberation often reveals that the original question was wrong.

### 3. Mandates survive coalition negotiation

Under the current system, UBI could be traded away in coalition talks even if parties supporting it got 50% of votes collectively. Under PolicyVote, the mandate exists independently—parliament must implement it regardless of which parties form the government.

### 4. Accountability becomes specific

"Did the government implement the conditional basic income mandate?" is answerable. "Did the government fulfill its promise to improve social security?" is not.

### 5. The "middle" is larger than it appears

Political discourse often presents UBI as a polarizing issue. This thought experiment suggests a substantial middle may exist—people open to various reform models. PolicyVote would make this middle visible and politically relevant.

## Limitations of This Thought Experiment

**This is illustrative, not predictive.** Real participation rates, voting patterns, and deliberation dynamics would differ. The numbers are plausible but invented to demonstrate structure, not forecast outcomes.

**Simplifications**:
- Real proposals would have more detail and more options
- Deliberation dynamics are complex and unpredictable
- Implementation challenges not fully modeled
- Conflict with other mandates not addressed
- Assumes higher participation than current digital democracy experiments typically achieve

**What it demonstrates**:
- How the structure changes incentives and outcomes
- Why cross-party policy consensus matters
- What specific accountability could look like
- The *type* of information that becomes available to citizens and representatives

## Possible Future Development

This thought experiment could evolve into a more rigorous simulation:

1. **Ground in polling data**: Use actual Finnish survey data on UBI support
2. **Analyze real deliberation**: Study existing Finnish discourse on UBI (media, party programs, citizens' initiative data)
3. **Model with realistic parameters**: Base participation rates on vTaiwan, Swiss referendum, and Finnish election data
4. **Expert review**: Get feedback from Finnish political scientists
5. **Interactive version**: Build a tool where users can explore different scenarios
