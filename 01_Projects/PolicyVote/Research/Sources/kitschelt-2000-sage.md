## Abstract

Research on democratic party competition in the formal spatial tradition of Downs and the comparative-historical tradition of Lipset and Rokkan assumes that linkages of accountability and responsiveness between voters and political elites work through politicians’ programmatic appeals and policy achievements. This ignores, however, alternative voter-elite linkages through the personal charisma of political leaders and, more important, selective material incentives in networks of direct exchange (clientelism). In light of the diversity of linkage mechanisms appearing in new democracies and changing linkages in established democracies, this article explores theories of linkage choice. It first develops conceptual definitions of charismatic, clientelist, and programmatic linkages between politicians and electoral constituencies. It then asks whether politicians face a trade-off or mutual reinforcement in employing linkage mechanisms. The core section of the article details developmentalist, statist, institutional, political-economic, and cultural-ideological theories of citizen-elite linkage formation in democracies, showing that none of the theories is fully encompassing. The final section considers empirical measurement problems in comparative research on linkage.

1.

1\. Of course, Hinich and Munger (1994) add to their functional definition of party the institutional element that parties must compete for office in elections.

2.

2\. McCubbins and Rosenbluth (1995, pp. 53-54) try to categorize the Japanese budget according to teleological criteria. I find this enterprise doomed to failure precisely because of the ambiguities involved in deciding whether a particular policy is rent seeking.

3.

3\. For the difference between political cleavages as dimensions of identification and as competitive dimensions, see Sani and Sartori (1983) and Kitschelt, Mansfeldova, Markowski, and Toka (1999, pp. 62-63, 223-261).

4.

4\. Hinich and Munger (1994) write, “Potential candidates for ideologies are almost impossibly sparse, because the creation and popularization of a new ideology are difficult tasks, requiring time, money, considerable organizational skills, and a compelling and exciting set of ideas” (p. 72). By contrast, Riker’s (1982, 1986) reconstruction of the realignment of the U.S. party system before the Civil War tends to belittle the difficulties of entry by creating a new dimension of competition.

5.

5\. Gibson (1997) shows how the exigencies of combining disparate constituencies and clientelist groups under the umbrellas of the Argentinean _Justicialists_ and the Mexican Revolutionary Institutionalized party (PRI) limited market liberal reforms in these countries.

6.

6\. The single best analysis of ballot format and personalization of political competition, although not in its relation to clientelism, is Carey and Shugart (1995). See Ames (1995a, 1995b) for the clientelist consequences of personalist arrangements, Mainwaring (1999, chap. 6, 8) for Brazil, and Cox and Rosenbluth (1995) for Japan with mixed cues (there is no vote pooling, but there is party control over nominations).

7.

7\. Shugart and Carey (1992), Carey and Shugart (1998), and Mainwaring and Shugart (1997) operationalize presidential-legislative power relations.

8.

8\. As Mainwaring and Shugart (1997) remind us, presidents, of course, do not want too much fragmentation in the legislature because that would raise their transaction costs of coalition building too high.

9.

9\. Candidates may run in both single-member districts (SMD) and on the lists of multimember districts (MMD). Parties are not obliged to rank their MMD candidates. In that case, the candidate on an unranked MMD list who is elected to parliament is the strongest loser in his or her SMD district. Thus, the personal following of candidates still matters in the new Japanese electoral system (cf. McKean & Scheiner, 1996).

10.

10\. For a formal model of cycles between clientelism and clean politics, driven by resource scarcity, see Bicchieri and Duffy (1997).

11.

11\. It appears to me that the explanations for the ethnopolitical displacement effect offered by Horowitz (1985, pp. 306-310) himself (irresistible voter pressure, centrifugal rivalry between party leaders at the top of multiethnic parties resulting in the victory of ethnic appeals) restate the explanandum more than submit an explanation. The same applies to the voluntarist suggestion that leaders of ethnocultural minorities choose independent organs of representation because they hope to coalesce with other parties and participate in government.

12.

12\. Of course, often such democracies have a tendency not to protect civil rights and political liberties very well. They qualify as pure electoral democracies (cf. Diamond, 1999, pp. 24-63).

13.

13\. For a related but somewhat different theoretical approach to gauge the prospects of patronage parties in post-Communist democracies, see Perkins (1996).
