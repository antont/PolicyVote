## Abstract

While political scientists regularly engage in spirited theoretical debates about elections and voting behavior, few have noticed that elected politicians also have theories of elections and voting. Here, we investigate politicians' positions on eight central theoretical debates in the area of elections and voting behavior and compare politicians' theories to those held by ordinary citizens. Using data from face-to-face interviews with nearly one thousand politicians in 11 countries, together with corresponding surveys of more than twelve thousand citizens, we show that **politicians overwhelmingly hold thin, minimalist, "democratic realist" theories of voting, while citizens' theories are more optimistic and policy oriented**. Politicians' theoretical tendencies—along with their theoretical misalignment from citizens—are remarkably consistent across countries. These theories are likely to have important consequences for how politicians campaign, communicate with the public, think about public policy, and represent their constituents.

## Key Findings

### Politicians vs Citizens - Key Differences

Politicians are significantly MORE likely than citizens to believe that voters are:
- **Leader-focused** rather than ideas/policy-focused
- **Egocentric** rather than sociotropic
- **Short-term** oriented rather than long-term
- **Single-issue** focused rather than multi-issue
- **Unfair** in blaming politicians for things outside their control ("blind retrospection")
- **Retrospective** rather than prospective

### Latent Class Analysis Results

**Four theoretical types identified:**

1. **Democratic Optimists** (policy-oriented view)
   - See voters as: fair, policy-oriented, prospective, sociotropic, multi-issue, knowledgeable, long-term oriented
   - **~35% of citizens** belong to this category
   - **Only 16% of politicians** belong to this category

2. **Democratic Realists** (minimalist view)
   - See voters as: unfair in blame, identity-oriented, retrospective, egocentric, single-issue, leader-driven, ignorant, short-term
   - **~35% of citizens** belong to this category
   - **73% of politicians** belong to this category

3. **Undecided** (~17% citizens, ~10% politicians)

4. **Inattentives** (~11% citizens, very few politicians)

### Cross-National Consistency

The politician-citizen gap is remarkably consistent across all 11 countries studied (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland).

## Relevance to PolicyVote

This paper provides empirical support for several key PolicyVote claims:

1. **Politicians don't believe voters care about policy** - 73% of politicians hold "democratic realist" views that see voters as NOT policy-oriented. This may explain why campaigns focus on personalities.

2. **Self-fulfilling prophecy** - The paper notes: "politicians who believe that voters are oriented to identity-based appeals rather than policy-based appeals are likely to spend more time communicating with constituents about relevant in-groups and out-groups than about policy, heightening the salience of group identities."

3. **Citizens ARE more policy-oriented than politicians think** - Citizens are much more evenly split between democratic optimism and realism. Politicians may be underestimating voter sophistication.

4. **System creates the behavior** - "politicians' theoretical beliefs about what voters want... may also serve over the longer term to reorient voters' behavior as well."

## Key Academic Concepts Referenced

- **Spatial voting theory** (Downs 1957) - voters choose based on policy proximity
- **Democratic realism** (Achen & Bartels 2016) - voters are identity-driven, not policy-driven
- **Retrospective vs prospective voting** (Fiorina 1981; Key 1966)
- **Programmatic vs personalistic representation** (Kitschelt 2000)
- **Mandate theory** (Pitkin 1967; Mansbridge 2003)
