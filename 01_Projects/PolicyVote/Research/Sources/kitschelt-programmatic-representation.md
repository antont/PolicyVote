## Core Concept

**Programmatic representation** = parties and politicians link to voters through explicit, coherent policy programs and implement them in office, so voters can judge and reward/punish based on policy performance rather than on material favors or personal charisma.

It is a **mode of exchange** between politicians and citizens, not simply a type of policy or party.

## The Three Linkage Types

Kitschelt distinguishes three ideal types of party-voter linkages:

### 1. Programmatic Linkages
- **Unit of benefit**: Generalized policy benefits (collective goods or class-targeted "club" goods) defined in impersonal, rule-based terms
- **Mode of exchange**: Impersonal, program-based; support conditional on adherence to programmatic pledges and policy performance
- **Accountability**: Via programmatic performance—did the party implement what it promised?
- **Examples**: Universal unemployment insurance, tax reform favoring specific income groups

### 2. Clientelistic Linkages
- **Unit of benefit**: Targeted, selective benefits (gifts, public jobs, contracts) directed to specific individuals in exchange for support
- **Mode of exchange**: Contingent, particularistic; support conditional on receipt of individualized material rewards
- **Accountability**: Brokers monitor individual behavior and selectively allocate benefits
- **Examples**: Patronage networks, vote-buying, preferential access to services

### 3. Charismatic-Personalistic Linkages
- **Unit of benefit**: Symbolic, identity-based appeals centered on leader personality
- **Mode of exchange**: Affective attachments, emotional identification with leader
- **Accountability**: Diffuse and personal; voters may forgive policy failures due to emotional attachment
- **Examples**: Leader-centric parties, populist movements built around personality

## Key Characteristics of Programmatic Parties

1. **Coherent, integrated policy program** — consistent set of issue positions, often ideologically structured
2. **Clear issue prioritization and differentiation** — signal which issues matter most, differentiate from competitors
3. **Institutionalized, collective organization** — not dominated by single charismatic leader; multiple veto players stabilize commitments
4. **Policy-centered campaigning and governing** — campaigns emphasize policy proposals over personalized appeals
5. **Impersonal, rule-based distribution** — benefits provided through general rules, not individually negotiated exchanges
6. **Issue- and performance-based accountability** — voters evaluate on policy proximity and performance
7. **Longer time horizons** — reputations for keeping promises matter; breaking program is costly to brand

## Critical Distinction

**The distinction is procedural, not teleological**: programmatic parties do NOT necessarily produce more collective goods than clientelistic ones. They differ in HOW support and benefits are linked, not in ultimate outputs.

## Relationship to PolicyVote

### What Kitschelt Describes vs What PolicyVote Proposes

| Aspect | Kitschelt's Framework | PolicyVote |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| **Scope** | Describes existing variation in party-voter linkages | Proposes structural change to electoral system |
| **Ballot** | Voters still choose parties/candidates | Voters choose policies directly |
| **Programmatic linkage** | One of three possible modes; varies by context | Structurally enforced by system design |
| **Personalistic possible?** | Yes, parties can mix strategies | Reduced—policies on ballot, not persons |
| **Clientelistic possible?** | Yes, especially in developing democracies | Reduced—votes go to policies, not brokers |

### PolicyVote as Mechanism to Enforce Programmatic Representation

PolicyVote is **not the same as** programmatic representation—it's a **mechanism designed to structurally guarantee it**.

Kitschelt shows that programmatic representation is:
- Normatively superior for accountability
- Variable across contexts and parties
- Competing with clientelistic and personalistic alternatives

PolicyVote attempts to **institutionalize programmatic linkages** by:
1. Making policy the explicit ballot item (not persons who might use any linkage type)
2. Removing the ability to compete on personality alone
3. Creating binding mandates that enforce policy-based accountability
4. Making cross-party policy support visible (strengthening programmatic over tribal appeals)

### Key Insight

In Kitschelt's framework, parties CHOOSE their linkage strategy based on context and incentives. PolicyVote changes the incentive structure to make programmatic linkages the dominant viable strategy—because that's literally what's on the ballot.

## The 2007 Book: Patrons, Clients and Policies

Kitschelt & Wilkinson's edited volume expands the theoretical framework with extensive empirical testing.

### Core Question
Why and how do democratic politicians build different types of linkages to voters – programmatic, clientelistic, or charismatic – and what determines their relative prevalence across countries?

### Principal-Agent Framework
- **Principals** = citizens/voters
- **Agents** = politicians and parties
- In idealized *programmatic* democracy, voters choose among parties offering policy platforms; after elections, voters evaluate parties based on collective goods and reward/punish them accordingly

### How They Operationalize Linkage Types

**Programmatic linkages** measured by:
- Expert judgments that parties "mainly compete on programmatic policy platforms"
- Survey items where voters report being influenced by policy positions rather than gifts/favors
- Party manifestos emphasizing national policy over local, personalized benefits

**Clientelistic linkages** measured by:
- Presence of targeted, conditional benefits (cash, food, jobs, permits)
- Evidence of broker-mediated exchanges
- Budget/allocation data showing particularistic targeting (e.g., distribution of development funds)
- Survey questions about receiving goods/services from politicians

**Charismatic linkages** measured by:
- Leader-centric party structures
- Voter survey items emphasizing personal admiration over policies or material rewards

### Key Theoretical Claims

1. **No single factor suffices** - neither modernization nor electoral institutions alone explain why some democracies are more programmatic

2. **Multiple interacting factors matter:**
   - Level and pattern of economic development
   - Party system structure and internal organization
   - State capacity and governance
   - Ethnic heterogeneity and social cleavages

3. **Challenges conventional wisdom:**
   - Economic modernization does NOT naturally erode clientelism (see Japan, Austria)
   - Electoral rules matter but don't determine linkage type by themselves

### Book Structure
- Theoretical introduction by Kitschelt & Wilkinson
- Comparative cross-national chapters using expert and survey data
- Country case studies: India, Latin America, Japan, Austria/Western Europe, Africa, Asia
- Concluding synthesis revisiting the framework
