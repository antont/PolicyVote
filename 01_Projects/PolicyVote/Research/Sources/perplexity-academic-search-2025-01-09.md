  Shows that more frequent initiatives and referendums **bring policies closer to median voter preferences**, explicitly treating these institutions as **policy-voting mechanisms** which correct elite-mass divergence.

## 2. Academic critiques of candidate-centered vs policy-/program-centered elections

### Key Works on Programmatic Representation

- **Kitschelt, Herbert. 2000. "Linkages between Citizens and Politicians in Democratic Polities." *Comparative Political Studies* 33(6–7): 845–879.**
  Introduces the influential distinction between **programmatic**, **clientelistic**, and **charismatic-personalistic** linkages; argues that **programmatic representation** (competition over policy programs) contrasts with **candidate-centered, personalistic** politics and is normatively superior for accountability.

- **Kitschelt, Herbert, and Steven I. Wilkinson, eds. 2007. *Patrons, Clients and Policies: Patterns of Democratic Accountability and Political Competition*. Cambridge University Press.**
  Systematic cross-national analysis of **programmatic vs personalistic/candidate-centered** party-voter linkages; shows conditions under which politics is about **policies** rather than **persons**.

- **Mair, Peter. 2009. "Representative versus Responsible Government." *MPIfG Working Paper* 09/8.**
  Discusses the tension between **programmatic party government** (policy-centered mandates) and a more **candidate-centered, professionalized political class**.

- **Thomassen, Jacques and Hermann Schmitt. 1997. "Policy Representation." *European Journal of Political Research* 32(2): 165–184.**
  Compares **policy-centered models of representation** (where parties offer programs and voters choose based on issues) with **candidate-centered models**, using European Election Study data.

- **Powell, G. Bingham Jr. 2000. *Elections as Instruments of Democracy: Majoritarian and Proportional Visions*. Yale University Press.**
  Contrasts **majoritarian, candidate-alternation** conceptions of elections with **proportional, programmatic policy representation**; argues that the latter better connects citizens' **policy preferences** to policy outcomes.
