Launched in 2014, vTaiwan is a decentralized open consultation process that combines online and
offline interactions, bringing together Taiwan's citizens and government to deliberate on
national issues. It serves as a model for People-Public-Private Partnerships (PPPP), involving
government ministries, elected representatives, scholars, experts, business leaders, civil
society organizations, and citizens in crafting digital legislation.


One of the many tools vTaiwan utilizes is Pol.is, a digital platform for opinion collection, to
facilitate large-scale conversations and consensus building. This tool has been pivotal in
achieving "rough consensus" on various policy issues at the national level, addressing
scalability challenges in deliberative democracy.

In 2023, vTaiwan collaborated with Chatham House and the AI Objectives Institute on the OpenAI
Democratic Inputs to AI project. This collaboration aimed to explore guiding principles for AI,
particularly in contexts where human rights intersect with local cultural or legal differences.
The main approach employed in this project included the use of Pol.is for public deliberation
and some initial attempts at integrating Large Language Models (LLMs).


In its ongoing role as a “shadow government,” vTaiwan is set to host more digital deliberative
topics, particularly as regulations try to keep pace with rapid technological advancements.
vTaiwan will continue to invite contributions from all societal sectors, initiating formal
discussions when needs are articulated. Looking ahead to 2024, vTaiwan anticipates engaging with
AI-related regulations, including the refined “Guidelines for the Executive Yuan and its
Agencies on the Use of Generative AI” and the “AI Basic Law” by the National Science and
Technology Council (NSTC).


The platform maintains various touchpoints for engagement, including its [community\\

Chinese-language website [vtaiwan.tw](https://vtaiwan.tw/), weekly online meetings
and occasional hackathons. As a dynamic, participant-driven space, vTaiwan strives to be a
pioneering model in democratic consultation, leveraging technology to foster in-depth
discussions on important national issues.

### A Few Accomplishments

More than 28 cases have been discussed through the vTaiwan process, and 80% of
them have led to some decisive government action.

#### Democratic Input of AI

In 2023, vTaiwan, in collaboration with Chatham House and the AI Objectives
Institute, participated in the OpenAI Democratic Inputs to AI project. This
partnership aimed to develop guiding principles for AI, focusing on human rights
considerations within different cultural and legal contexts. The process included
using Pol.is for public deliberation and experimenting with Large Language Models
(LLMs). The initiative also incorporated a structured participation process:
identifying issues, collating expert knowledge, engaging stakeholders, opening a
[Pol.is consultation](https://pol.is/report/r6hfjzrmeh6dwabymabne), and
using AI to analyze results. Following this, face-to-face
consultations were held to delve deeper, refine [face-to-face discussions](https://youtu.be/quOjUG6X8w4), and finally
allocate items of strong consensus to primary documents, while contentious issues were
earmarked for further follow-up. This process aimed to incorporate Taiwan's
perspectives into global AI development, including ChatGPT and other LLM platforms.

#### Regulated Uber

vTaiwan hosted [UberX case](https://vtaiwan.tw/topic/uberx) to discuss
about Uber problem in Taiwan. More than 4000 participants crowd-sourced our [meeting\\
agenda](https://www.slideshare.net/autang/g0v-a-le-gouvernement/77) for an [open\\
consultation meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxHkGq57pWw) via 4 weeks of [public survey](https://pol.is/3phdex2kjf) on Pol.is. Uber agreed to [vTaiwan’s\\
coherent blended volition](https://blog.pol.is/uber-responds-to-vtaiwans-coherent-blended-volition-3e9b75102b9b), and the administration pledged to ratify [all the\\
Pol.is consensus items](https://speakerdeck.com/audreyt/g0v-fork-the-government?slide=97) into [a new\\

#### FinTech Sandbox

vTaiwan helped pass the FinTech sandbox act, the regulation that empowers financial
technology field to conduct transparent, accountable small scale experiments that
are currently unregulated by the law.

#### Non-Consensual Intimate Images

The devastating consequence of non-consensual intimate images (NCII) has recently
been on the table around the globe, the community members and volunteers of vTaiwan
all agreed this is a burning issue that we ought to examine. A Pol.is survey was
launched during June 7th, 2017 to July 21st, 2017. Online discussion helped shelters
the victims from exposure to include more stakeholders to preserve the diversity of
viewpoints and experiences.

### Things I Can Do

As an open project, vTaiwan attracts people from multiple disciplines including law makers,
public servants, developers, designers, writers, researchers, journalists, film makers and much
more.
Therefore, we contribute our skills in different ways. Here is a list of things vTaiwan
contributors have been doing, go ahead and have look and see how you would like to contribute:


- Write all the code
- Stack small boxes

- Chat with everyone
- Book hackathon venue
- Discover stakeholders
- Compile an open dictionary
- Show some interest
- Edit shared documents
- Ask many questions

### How It Works

The vTaiwan process consists of four successive stages - proposal, opinion, reflection and
legislation - supported by a selection of colloborative open source engagement tools.

### More About vTaiwan

Makers, bloggers, thinkers and other contributors have helped us tell the story of vTaiwan in
their eyes. See how people in touch with us help us describe what vTaiwan is.

#### Tom Atlee featured vTaiwan in his blog

[![](https://info.vtaiwan.tw/images/tom.jpg)](http://www.tomatleeblog.com/?s=vTaiwan) The face-to-face stakeholder conversations are intentionally
diverse, professionally facilitated and, when preceded by a pol.is process, grounded in the
differences and consensus statements that arose from that process, usually requiring
point-by-point responses. And an interesting leading edge of vTaiwan development is the use of
3D cameras in live-streamed stakeholder dialogues to allow observers with appropriate apps to
immerse themselves in virtual reality representations of those conversations.
Also, two interesting points raise the quality of personal pol.is engagements into the realm of
conversation. First, pol.is was designed to eliminate the tendency of online comment forums to
degrade into mutual trolling, while allowing full expression of creative ideas and rational
discussion. Second, research shows that in many cases when a participant registers a
“disagreement” with someone’s statement, they shortly thereafter submit a statement of their own
that provides a solution to their underlying concern. Thus, even without the direct
interactivity of conversations and comment forums, pol.is nevertheless evokes dialogic and
deliberative “communication acts” among its participants in which they are influenced by each
other’s perspectives.

#### Christian Svanes Kolding directed a video for vTaiwan

[![](https://info.vtaiwan.tw/images/christian.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/259324525/4cd1218115) In a tumultuous time where the utopian visions once offered by
social media seem to have been subverted into systems of oligarchic power, while trust in
institutions and government is at a historical tipping point, how does one build a platform for
millions of users to create new avenues for meaningful dialogue? In short, how does one design
for trust? These are the challenges that g0v (gov zero), a collective of activists, coders,
designers, scholars and ordinary citizens, took on four years ago in taiwan and in response,
they created vTaiwan. Conceived in collaboration with the government, vTaiwan is a digital
platform and a civic deliberation process for shaping legislation. By in essence creating a
virtual public commons, it revitalizes the way citizens engage with their government, and how
governments engage with their citizens. Through its transparency, which results in a greater
degree of public trust and legitimacy, it offers a template for online discourse that is still
in use to this day and applicable across the world.
