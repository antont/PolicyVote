## Modern platform    with strong principles

We have combined four strong principles into one platform to unleash the full potential of the participants.

1

### Transparent process

LiquidFeedback's integrated proposal development and decision making process guarantees full transparency and accountability.

2

### Collective moderation

Equal rights for all participants while ensuring that vocal groups don't disrupt the discussion process—without the need for a moderator.

3

### Power delegation

Scalability through the division of labor: Participate in issues you are interested in and give your voice to somebody for everything else.

4

### Preferential aggregation

LiquidFeedback doesn't ask predefined questions. It encourages to develop alternatives and express true preferences.

## Wide range of supported scenarios

LiquidFeedback has been optimized for a wide range of scenarios and can be easily configured for your context.

### Business

Unleash the creativity of employees, involve them

in organizational and development decisions.

### Government

Caucus negotiations among committee members

and empowerment of constituents.

### Public administrations

Citizen participation for co-creation, deliberation, and restoring public trust.

### NGOs

Empowerment of members through participation

or full democratic self-governance.

### Cooporatives

Democratic self-organization for cooperatives

and employee owned companies.

### Social movements

Collective agenda setting and responsive

decision-making structures.

## LiquidFeedback adjusts  to your environment

From the beginning, we designed and coded LiquidFeedback to be extensible, maintainable, interoperable, and portable.

### Extensibility

LiquidFeedback accommodates your business rules and procedures by configuration. You don't need to change the code to adapt it to your organizational requirements.

### Maintainability

LiquidFeedback allows you to reflect changes in your environment by updating the configuration. Your data will be migrated automatically with each update.

### Interoperability

LiquidFeedback integrates with your existing IT and can be connected to Active Directory, LDAP or OAuth2. You can use it from almost any device that supports a web browser.

### Portability

There is no vendor lock-in: The data is stored in a SQL database, so you can transfer the data to third-party applications or use it in scripts for additional functionality.
