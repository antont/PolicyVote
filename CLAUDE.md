## Version Control

**CRITICAL - START EVERY SESSION**: Always run `git pull` at the beginning of each new Claude session.

**Commit workflow**:
- After creating new notes: `git add .` → `git commit -m "message"` → `git push`
- After significant edits: Commit and push immediately
- Use `git status` to check for modifications

## PARA Method Details

### Projects (01)
- Time-bound initiatives with clear completion criteria
- **Your current project:** PolicyVote
- Recommended subfolders: Research/, Drafts/, Output/

### Areas (02)
- Ongoing responsibilities without end dates
- Add folders as needed for: Work, Health, Finances, etc.

### Resources (03)
- Topics of interest for reference
- Add folders for research topics like: AI/LLMs, Virtual Worlds, Python, etc.

### Archive (04)
- Completed or inactive items
- Move entire project folders here when done

---

## Inbox Management

### Core Principles
- Inbox is temporary, not permanent storage
- Process weekly using Capture → Process → Organize workflow
- Maintain <20 items at any time

### Processing Workflow
1. Delete obsolete information
2. Move relevant material to PARA locations
3. Convert actions into project tasks
4. Tag items needing more processing with `#needs-processing`

---

## File Naming Conventions

- Daily notes: `YYYY-MM-DD - Topic`
- Meeting notes: `Meeting - [Topic] - YYYY-MM-DD`
- Ideas: `Idea - [Brief Description]`
- Resources: `Resource - [Topic] - [Source]`

---

## Helper Scripts

```bash
pnpm vault:stats           # Show vault statistics
pnpm attachments:list      # List unprocessed files
pnpm attachments:organized # Count organized files
pnpm attachments:orphans   # Find unreferenced files
```

## Available Slash Commands

- `/setup-firecrawl` - Configure Firecrawl for web research

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Structure
- Use `[[WikiLinks]]` for internal references
- Include YAML frontmatter (dates, tags, status)
- Consistent Markdown formatting

### Style
- Direct and confident statements
- Avoid clichéd transitions
- Let statements stand on their own

---

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### Before Any Organization
1. Map complete folder structure: `find . -type d | sort`
2. Verify all destination folders exist

### Working with Content
- Respect numbered core files (never move 00-06 prefixed files)
- Always use `mv` not `cp` when organizing
- Preserve and update bidirectional links
- Add appropriate YAML frontmatter

### Simple Commands Only
- **REQUIRED**: Direct, basic commands without filtering
- **FORBIDDEN**: Complex regex, piped commands, find with filters
